        Serious Software, Friendly Company.
        Software is our craft and our passion. At Zoho, we create beautiful software to solve business problems. We
        believe that software is the ultimate product of the mind and the hands.

        But as much as we love building beautiful software, we think our people and company culture are our most
        important assets. Our engineers spend years mastering their craft, bringing together decades of engineering
        expertise to produce a real work of art. When you choose Zoho, you get more than just a single product or a
        tightly integrated suite. You get our commitment to continuous refinement and to improving your experience. And
        you get our relentless devotion to your satisfaction.

        The art of software.
        A focus on what matters.
        Zoho is committed to spending your money wisely. We invest more in product development and customer support than
        in sales and marketing. It always struck us as paradoxical to charge the customer extra for the privilege of
        marketing back to them. By keeping our cost of attracting customers low, we keep our prices affordable and pass
        the savings onto our users.

        We’re gentle in our sales approach, so we don't push our people to push you. You won’t find us trying to
        endlessly upsell you, or buying your loyalty through multi-year contracts. And with growth that regularly
        outstrips our competitors, we know that this model works.

        A focus on what matters.
        A private company with
        a public vision.
        We’ve stayed private and we’ve never taken other people’s money. Neither will change. This keeps us independent
        and beholden to only the customer, permitting a long term view to naturally unfold. We are private, but far from
        small. With nearly 10,000 employees across the globe, our style of unconventional thinking seems to have paid
        off.

        Our investment in people is a vital part of our R&D edge. We have a comprehensive program to hire high school
        students and train them - a program we call Zoho Schools of Learning. Over 15% of our engineers come from this
        program. Not only is the program good for our company, it is also good for the communities we live in.

        India.
        Free from prying eyes.
        The decision to value customer privacy isn't one you make after watching which way the wind blows. It must stem
        from prior belief, perhaps even dogma. This is exactly why we made the decision more than two decades ago that
        we weren't going to sell ads inside our products, not even within the free editions. We're not interested in
        tracking your clicks to feed the marketing monster. We will make our money the traditional way—bringing you
        valuable software that you are happy to pay us for.

        So why did we make this choice to put privacy first? Simple. We valued our privacy; we figured you would, too.
        And that's why we've prided ourselves on being ahead of the curve when it comes to government regulations about
        privacy; we don't need to be told what good business should look like.

        Free from prying eyes.
        A product to meet
        every need.
        Over the years, we've crafted dozens of products with equal fervor. Now they are even available under one single
        integrated suite, Zoho One, that can put a business completely on the cloud. Unlike our competitors, who
        periodically wake up to discover gaping product holes that they must now fill urgently with acquisitions to
        reassure their shareholders, we craft our portfolio with patience and anticipation.

        Our strategy is born from the realization that the vast majority of acquisitions fail, and it’s the customer
        that pays the price. Many of our products were developed to meet our own needs—for Zoho itself runs entirely on
        Zoho. This means our software often must fail us, before it can fail you.
